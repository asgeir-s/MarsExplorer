Scenario
-------------
The Mars Explorer scenario was presented by L Steels.

**The objectives are**

 * to explore a distant planet, and in particular,
 * to collect sample of a precious rock
 * the location of the samples is not known in advance, but it is known that they tend to be clustered
 * Agents are limited in the amount of sample they can carry at a given time
 * Obstacles impede motion in some cells


**The model includes**
 * mother ship broadcasts radio signal which weakens with distance. Thus, an agent knows how to return to the mother ship and how far away it is.
 * no map of the area is available â€“ and the agents have insufficient space to store one
 * We are interested in the collaborative best solution which is based on the amount of sample collected in a specified number of time steps.
 * There is no means of contacting other agents directly. The only communication is stigmergic (by modifying the environment itself)
